## [#30] Lobby Feature — 2026-04-24 14:00
### Added
- `Task<List<string>> GetLobbyMembers(long partyId)` to `IPartyRepository` and `IPartyService`
- Implementation in `PartyRepository`: queries `PartyGroups` by `partyId`, flattens through `PartyMembers`, returns `User.Username`
- Delegation in `PartyService` to `_partyRepository.GetLobbyMembers(partyId)`
- `LobbyResponse` DTO (`PartyId`, `PartyName`, `Members`, `Code`, `IsReady`) in `Goalz.Application/DTOs/`
- `ILobbyService` interface with `JoinLobby(partyId, username)` in `Goalz.Application/Interfaces/`
- `LobbyService` in `Goalz.Application/Services/`: validates party + user exist, fetches current members, builds `LobbyResponse`
- `LobbyController` at `GET /api/game/party/{partyId}/lobby` — `[Authorize]`, delegates to `ILobbyService`
- `PartyHub` (SignalR) in `Goalz.API/Hubs/`: `JoinLobbyRoom`, `SendMemberJoined`, `StartGame`
- `AddSignalR()` + `MapHub<PartyHub>("/hubs/party")` registered in `Program.cs`
- `AllowCredentials()` added to CORS policy (required for SignalR WebSocket handshake)

### Rationale
- `List<string>` usernames keeps the lobby response lightweight — no need to expose full user objects
- SignalR groups keyed on `partyId.ToString()` so each party gets an isolated broadcast channel
- `IsReady` defaults to `false` — owner ready-state is not yet persisted in the Party entity; field is reserved for a future migration
